OpenESpin Project.
These are the files to build the Electrospinner entered into the 2017 HackaDay prize contest.
If you find you are missing a file when building the machine let me know and I'll dig it up.
Assembly instructions and a BOM are now available, but in an early stage, so I'd expect some
changes to them as I find all the bugs and typos.
