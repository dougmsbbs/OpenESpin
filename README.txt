OpenESpin Project.
These are the files to build the Electrospinner entered into the 2017 HackaDay prize contest.
The files are still being gathered, prepared and uploaded. That means these may not be complete. If you find you are missing a file when building the machine let me know and I'll dig it up.
Build instructions and a BOM are also in the works.
